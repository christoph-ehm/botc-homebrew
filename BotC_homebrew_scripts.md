# Homebrew Character guidelines

## good characters

- allow for bluffability
- obtained info should only concern the game state if the player can freely choose what info they get. (e.g. the Artist or Gossip violates this principle)
- should not be able to confirm more than 1 player
- strong (info) characters must be repudiable, therefore cannot be confirmed by their own ability (e.g. the Gambler violates this principle)
- confirmed players cannot nominate/vote or have lost their ability
- any player can at most associate one character with one player due to their ability.

## Fabled

- plural: Fabled
- Fabled characters helps the story teller to make a game or the script fairer and more accessible
- Fabled characters are created to make the game easier or more balanced

## Loric

- Lorics are created to add tension, challenges or increase the difficulty for all or specific players.
- this is the reason why the original game wants you to declare Lorics that you use.

# Script Guidelines

- contains sufficient info characters for identifying the evil players of a 15 player game, 2 different characters who can validate other characters
- for each weak info character, there should be a protection character
- evil players should be able to repudiate any ping of being evil or an evil character. (By repudiating the ping player or by bluffing a character that explains the contradiction.)
- every character can be repudiated, info can be repudiated by the info of other characters
  - this allows evil players to defend themselve when there is a ping on them
  - Characters cannot be proven or strictly confirmed with only one ability (e.g. in Bad Moon Rising, the Demon kills per night can vary such that the Gossip or Gambler claim can be repudiated)
- covert characters have another character that they could bluff
- bonus: players don't confirm easily as there are multiple reasons for an ability's event to occur

## Imppreposterous Syncretastrophy (Synaesthetic Ideology)

Alignment, Level changes and Metagaming included.

- Townsfolk
  - choose a Townsfolk character according to Whale Buffet
  - Farmer
  - If you die from the Demon, the story teller chooses for the Demon player who gets drunk and must choose players to balance the game.
  - You learn the number of abilities for some "categories" that are in play. (Protection, attack, info, effects, winning condition.)
  - Chatterbox: Game actions are commented by the story teller in a story-telling way, revealing indirectly what happened during the night or the day (but only the fictional entities, never associating the players in physical reality). (The Huntsman chose the Damsel → "Congratulations to the lucky couple who celebrated their marriage last night. A Damsel of honor fell in love with a strong Huntsman who rescued her from her dungeon.")

- Outsider
  - Vagrant
  - you get a new character instead of dying but you register as dead towards the ending condition.

- Minion
  - You add a Loric to the game that only you know
  - You add a Jinx to the game that only you know
  - One or all players kill an alive otherwise dead neighbour instead of the actual target (whenever they attack, execute or kill)
    - if it is only 1, you might choose who.
  - Alive players win if they lose and lose if they win, even if you are dead. It does not affect dead players.
    - e.g. choose 1 good player at night 1 for who this happens. They don't learn about this until you tell them.
    - Minions cannot change the character of the Demon into a non-Demon, as long as this ability holds. (E.g. the Pit-Hag.)
  - Mephisto

- Demon
  - choose a known or official Demon character. The Story Teller declares ≤ 4 Demons that could be in play. Others cannot.
  - choose 2 or 3 players who get deranged. If no-one dies from them, 1 of them dies instead at dawn.
  - Follower: 2 players start being haunted. Each night, a haunted player ("you") has to choose another player to be haunted. If this player already is hunted, you die, otherwise you get haunted again if this chosen player has died. Evil players know who are haunted. You register as a different in-play character to different players.
  - Each day, curse 1 player. If a player points at a cursed player at night, one of both dies. The curse of a player only goes away if the cursed player has died. (Therefore, it can only go away for dead players when the diey again, e.g. after resurrection.) (A player who cannot wake at night is more likely to die than one who does.) The Demon may also choose themself in which case they Demon never dies. Minions are less likely to die than good characters.

    - Every player gets to know how many lives they have when it changes.
  * Everyone has multiple or N *characters* (not just abilities)
  * Everyone gets N-times a new character instead of dying
    - of the same character type
    - of a different character type → Demon lives only once, except if someone else gets Demon before.
  * Noone knows their alignment, only another player person who is in their team and one who isn't
  * Everyone has a Level. (Level System)
    - instead of killing, there are points?
  * There are N alignments
