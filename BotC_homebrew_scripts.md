# Homebrew Character guidelines

## good characters

- allow for bluffability
- obtained info should only concern the game state if the player can freely choose what info they get. (e.g. the Artist or Gossip violates this principle)
- should not be able to confirm more than 1 player
- strong (info) characters must be repudiable, therefore cannot be confirmed by their own ability (e.g. the Gambler violates this principle)
- confirmed players cannot nominate/vote or have lost their ability
- any player can at most associate one character with one player due to their ability.

## Fabled

- plural: Fabled
- Fabled characters helps the story teller to make a game or the script fairer and more accessible
- Fabled characters are created to make the game easier or more balanced

## Loric

- Lorics are created to add tension, challenges or increase the difficulty for all or specific players.
- this is the reason why the original game wants you to declare Lorics that you use.

# Script Guidelines

- contains sufficient info characters for identifying the evil players of a 15 player game, 2 different characters who can validate other characters
- for each weak info character, there should be a protection character
- evil players should be able to repudiate any ping of being evil or an evil character. (By repudiating the ping player or by bluffing a character that explains the contradiction.)
- every character can be repudiated, info can be repudiated by the info of other characters
  - this allows evil players to defend themselve when there is a ping on them
  - Characters cannot be proven or strictly confirmed with only one ability (e.g. in Bad Moon Rising, the Demon kills per night can vary such that the Gossip or Gambler claim can be repudiated)
- covert characters have another character that they could bluff
- bonus: players don't confirm easily as there are multiple reasons for an ability's event to occur
