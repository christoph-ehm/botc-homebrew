A GUI for the JSON files is available at <https://www.bloodstar.xyz/> which however doesn't support the newer inventions of BotC such as the new Loric category of characters or newer experimental characters.

Defining a character as Loric requires changing `"team": "fabled"` into `"team": "loric"` in the JSON file.

I made a Browser Userscript to create nice PDF exports of Homebrew Scripts, even if they are too large:
