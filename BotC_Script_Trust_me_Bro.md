"Trust me, Bro!"

möglichst viele Siegmodifikationen. Viel Blöffen und Raten. Wenig und möglicherweise defekte Inforollen.
- Atheist (soll defekt sein können)
- Cult Leader
- Innkeeper*
- Gossip
- Dreamer*
- Savant
- Alsaahir
- Grandmother (interesting with Leviathan and Politician)
- Gambler*
- Poppy Grower + Snitch combined
- Chambermaid* (few good people wake at night, each night = `*`, one night only = `(*)`, this makes this role valuable)
- Bounty Hunter* (do not make the bounty hunter the evil townsfolk, trust will become difficult in case of Legion)
- Knight(*) (Knight + Legion would be quite funny, the knight may get itself as info)
- Sage (usually, the evil team might win quickly. This allows the good team to win quickly and make the demon afraid of killing bully-outed people.)
- Seelenverwandte(*) (Storm-catched)
- Polymath
- (Farmer) (meta reasoning)
- (Mayor) (good wins when no execution happens when 3 people are left)

Outsider:
- Lunatic*
- Politician 
- Heretic
- Damsel
- Klutz (interesting with Legion)
- Puzzlemaster (allowing for Drunk Atheist, useful for Pandemon)
- Saint (might seem redundant with a Good Twin or Goblin instead, but its interaction with a politician and evil people is very unique)
- (Plague Doctor) (turning the story teller into an evil twin is almost funny, turning into Xaan changes the outsiders)
- (Barber) (evil switches two characters when this dies)
- (Recluse)
- (Ogre*)
- (Goon)

Minions:
- Xaan (any number of outsiders)
- Evil Twin(*) (interesting with the Politician as good twin)
- Goblin
- Bully* (Personen müssen sich am nächsten Tag offenbaren, sonst können sie sterben)
- Fearmonger* (with Heretic this can be brutal)
- Spy*
- (Pit-Hag*) (a pit-hag making a demon can seem like an atheist is in play, causes havoc when heretic is in play)
- (Marionette)
- (Boffin)
- (Wizard(*))
- (Mastermind) (in combination with Mayer)
- (Mezepheles) (use with Yaggababble, kind of cheap with Spirit of Ivory)

Demons:
- Vortox* (upside down info)
- Leviathan (no demon kills but any executions)
- Legion (no minions, 2/3 players are demon)
- Fang Gu* (killed outsider gets demon instead, good with knight, +1 outsider)
- Pandemon (has all minions abilities, all minions are defect, demon detection is defect)
- (Yaggababble) (saying a phrase kills a person each time)
- (Kazali*) (choose your minions at setup time, any outsiders)
- (Lord of Typhon) (additional minions but all in one row)

Travellers:
- Beggar
- Scapegoat
- Butcher
- Harlot
- Barista
- Voudon
- (Cacklejack)
- (Bureaucrat)

Fableds:
- Trustmaker (vertraute Personen kann man nicht voten und exekutieren dich mit, dafür weißt du, wenn diese nachts auf dich zeigen und du kannst bei einer tödlichen Exekution sehen, welche Figur und Alignment die vertraute Person hatte)
- Revolutionary (two people of equal alignment set next to each other, one time misregistered)
- Djinn (jinxes)
- Doomsayer (everyone may wish to have one person of their alignment killed)
- Sentinel (-1 to +1 outsider)
- Hell's Librarian (do nasty stuff with players who won't be quiet)
- Spirit of Ivory (at most one player gets evil additionally)
- Ferryman (all dead have one vote token on the final day)

Lorics:
- Bootlegger (see JSON for most recent list)

- optional: Stormcatcher, e.g.
  - Soulmate
  - Cult Leader
  - an info character if it is the only good info character
  - NOT bounty hunter!c
- optional: Zenomancer
  - Zenomancer (Politician): When the politician is mad about ending the game upon their execution (or a character that would), after execution they learn one not-in-play strong good character that is not an evil bluff.

- homebrew jinxes

  ```
  Legionatic / Anarchist: The Anarchist *might* register as good to Legion.
  Legionatic / Spy: If a Legionatic has a drunk spy ability, they see no Legionatic characters in the grimoire but the Legionatics' drunk abilities plus 1 demon.
  Spy / Poppy Snitch: If the Poppy Snitch has their ability, the Spy does not see the Grimoire.
  Spy / Wicked: Both cannot be in play together.
  Soulmate: The Soulmate ability is drunk for players who learnt the demon (e.g. via minion info).
  Atheist: In an atheist game, the story teller manipulates ≤ 1 person's abilities, misregisters ≤ X players as evil minions/demons, fakes minion signals & has 1 demon ability. [X = regular # of evil]
  Alsaahir: The Alsaahir's guess applies to the actual character type, else (if incorrect) to the misregistered one.
  Alsaahir / Legionatic: With Legionatic in play, the Alsaahir may guess the Townsfolk & Outsider players instead.
  Puzzlemaster / Legionatic: The Puzzledrunk is not a Legion(atic). When the sober+healthy puzzlemaster guesses right, they learn a 3rd non-Legion player.
  Puzzlemaster: The Puzzlemaster bypasses misregistration. If the Puzzlemaster guesses themself, they learn *another* non-demon player.
  Plotter: Outsiders/Minions who don't know their character type cannot be in play with the Plotter. [Lunatic, Puzzledrunk]
  Plotter / Wicked: If Plotter is in play, the Wicked gets equal to a Heretic.
  Diabolus / Sage: Each night*, the Leviathan chooses an alive good player (different to previous nights): a chosen Sage uses their ability but does not die.
  Polymath / Lunatic: If the Polymath is a Lunatic, the demon and Polymath don't know who is demon/Polymath.
  Trustmaker / Soulmate: A soulmate vessel nevertheless triggers the Trustmaker reward on death.
