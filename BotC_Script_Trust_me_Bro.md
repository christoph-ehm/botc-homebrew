"Trust me, Bro!"

möglichst viele Siegmodifikationen. Viel Blöffen und Raten. Wenig und möglicherweise defekte Inforollen.
- Rationalist (Atheist) (interessant mit Politician, Bounty Hunter, Puzzledrunk oder mit einem Philsopher)
- (Cult Leader)
- Adulterator (Innkeeper*)
- Blabber (Gossip)
- (Dreamer*)
- (Savant)
- (Alsaahir)
- [(Grandmother)] (interesting with Leviathan)
- Faustian* (Gambler+Lycanthrope)
- Poppy Snitch (Poppy Grower + Snitch combined)
- (Chambermaid*) (few good people wake at night, each night = `*`, one night only = `(*)`, this makes this role valuable)
- (Bounty Hunter*) (do not make the bounty hunter the evil townsfolk, trust will become difficult in case of Legion)
- (Knight(*)) (Knight + Legion would be quite funny, the knight may get itself as info)
- (Sage) (usually, the evil team might win quickly. This allows the good team to win quickly and make the demon afraid of killing bully-outed people.)
- Seelenverwandte(*) (Storm-catched)
- Puzzledrunk (false Wizard claims would help to obscure insights of strong players)
- Muezzin (Adulterator, Puzzlemaster and Prosecutor can make players drunk. With Muezzin, only one of your team can be. If the Muezzin is evil, Pandemon poisons ≤1 Minion and the Legionatic is like an enhanced Legion.)
- [(Farmer)] (meta reasoning)
- [(Mayor)] (good wins when no execution happens when 3 people are left)

Outsider:
- (Lunatic*) [fits to Atheist, Pandemon, Polymath]
- Master Hora (multiple executions consecutively, fits to Trustmaker, Butcher, Leviathan/Diabolus)
- [Anarchist]
- (Politician) (fits to Heretic, Atheist and may (double) claim the Saint, the Good Twin, the Goblin or the Puzzledrunk)
- Wicked (Heretic)
- Victim  (originally Damsel)
- Maverick (Klutz) (interesting with Legion)
- Prosecutor
- [(Saint)] (might seem redundant with a Good Twin or Goblin instead, but its interaction with a politician and evil people is very unique)
- [(Plague Doctor)] (turning the story teller into an evil twin is almost funny, turning into Xaan changes the outsiders)
- [(Barber)] (evil switches two characters when this dies)
- [(Recluse)]
- [(Ogre*)]
- [(Goon)]

Minions:
- Plotter (originally Xaan)
- (Evil Twin(*)) (interesting with the Politician as good twin)
- (Goblin)
- Bully* (Personen müssen sich am nächsten Tag offenbaren, sonst können sie sterben)
- Scaremonger* (alternative to Fearmonger) (with Wicked this can be brutal)
- (Spy*) (added because they can appear and play like a good Townsfolk character, interesting for Cult Leader or various info characters)
- [(Pit-Hag*)] (a pit-hag making a demon can seem like an atheist is in play, causes havoc when heretic is in play)
- [(Marionette)]
- [(Boffin)]
- [(Wizard(*))]
- [(Mastermind)] (in combination with Mayer)
- [(Mezepheles)] (use with Yaggababble, kind of cheap with Spirit of Ivory)

Demons:
- (Vortox*) (upside down info)
- (Leviathan) (no demon kills but any executions)
- Diabolus (only together with Leviathan)
- Legionatic (alternative to Legion) (no minions, 2/3 players are demon)
- (Fang Gu*) (killed outsider gets demon instead, good with knight, +1 outsider)
- Pandemon (has all minions abilities, all minions are defect, demon detection is defect)
- [(Yaggababble)] (saying a phrase kills a person each time)
- [(Kazali*)] (choose your minions at setup time, any outsiders)
- [(Lord of Typhon)] (additional minions but all in one row)

Travellers:
- (Beggar)
- (Scapegoat)
- (Butcher)
- (Harlot)
- Time Eater
- [(Barista)]
- [(Voudon)]
- [(Cacklejack)]
- [(Bureaucrat)]

Fableds:
- [Revolutionary] (two people of equal alignment set next to each other, one time misregistered)
- (Doomsayer) (everyone may wish to have one person of their alignment killed)
- (Sentinel) (-1 to +1 outsider)
- [Hell's Librarian] (do nasty stuff with players who won't be quiet)
- Probationer, Spirit of Irony (extension of Spirit of Ivory) (at most one player gets evil additionally)
- (Ferryman) (all dead have one vote token on the final day)

Lorics:
- Bootlegger (see JSON for most recent list)
- Trustmaker (vertraute Personen kann man nicht voten und exekutieren dich mit, dafür weißt du, wenn diese nachts auf dich zeigen und du kannst bei einer tödlichen Exekution sehen, welche Figur und Alignment die vertraute Person hatte)
- Polymath (Undertaker as a Loric that distributes info among players)
- [Introvert] (the Story Teller turns into a player with a secret character that gives info to those players who guess the character privately, a bit much)

- (Pope) (fits to the Polymath, Puzzledrunk, Legionatic)
- (Stormcatcher)
  - Soulmate
  - Cult Leader
  - an info character if it is the only good info character
  - NOT bounty hunter!c
- [Zenomancer]
  - Zenomancer (Politician): When the politician is mad about ending the game upon their execution (or a character that would), after execution they learn one not-in-play strong good character that is not an evil bluff.

- homebrew jinxes

  * Alsaahir: The Alsaahir's guess applies to the actual character type, else (if incorrect) to the misregistered one.
  * Alsaahir / Legionatic: With Legionatic in play, the Alsaahir may guess the Townsfolk & Outsider players instead.
  * Puzzledrunk / Legionatic: The Puzzledrunk is not a Legion(atic). When the sober+healthy Puzzledrunk guesses right, they learn a 3rd non-Legion player.
  * Puzzledrunk / Muezzin: If the Puzzledrunk is in play, the Muezzin allows for ≤ 2 drunk abilities in their team.
  * Master Hora / Leviathan: Master Hora shifts a night only when a good player is executed. Master Hora dies if chosen by Leviathan at night.
  * Spy / Poppy Snitch: If the Poppy Snitch has their ability, the Spy does not see the Grimoire.
  * Spy / Wicked: Both cannot be in play together.
  * Plotter / Lunatic: Outsiders/Minions who don't know their character type cannot be in play with the Plotter.
  * Plotter / Wicked: If Plotter is in play, the Wicked is equal to a Heretic.
  * Legionatic / Spy: If a Legionatic has a drunk spy ability, they see no Legionatic characters in the grimoire but the Legionatics' drunk abilities plus 1 demon.
  * Legionatic / Politician: The Politician might register as evil to the Legionatic.
  * Diabolus / Sage: Each night*, the Leviathan chooses an alive good player (different to previous nights): a chosen Sage uses their ability but does not die.
  * Polymath / Lunatic: If the Polymath player is a Lunatic, the demon and Polymath don't know who is demon/Polymath.
  * Trustmaker / Soulmate: A soulmate vessel nevertheless triggers the Trustmaker reward on death.
  * Trustmaker / Puzzledrunk: The Puzzledrunk does not misregister to the Trustmaker.
